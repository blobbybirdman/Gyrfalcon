The structure and flight style were distinctive enough that had I seen the bird in summer I would not have hesitated to call it a barn swallow. The bird had long wings that curled up slightly at the tips as it glided. The head was short and stubby seeming, the body looked streamlined with belly and throat contrastingly pale with a rufous tinge. I was unfortunately unable to get a clear view of the tail, neither did I see any contrast between the throat and belly color."
